        In September 2015, the 17 UNSDGs went into effect to accomplish the goals that correspond with them by 2030. 
        One of the 17 UNSDGs that emphasizes the significance of preventing climate change is Goal 13, also known as Climate Action. 
        Everyone must contribute since the effects of climate change affect them all.
        If we do nothing, the effects on both our planet and ourselves will only worsen. consequences include worsening heatwaves, wildfires, 
        flooding, droughts, famines, and sea level rise. The emission of greenhouse gases is currently at an all-time high right now. If nothing 
        else is done, the average global temperature will rise throughout the 21st century and is currently predicted to surpass 3 degrees Celcius 
        this Century with other parts of the world having a higher increase. </p>

        Our world has had increases in average temperatures before, but never on this scale. To address this issue, countries took on
        the Paris Agreement, at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris on 12th of December 2015, 
        which was put into place a year later. The Agreement was put into place to get countries to take action, while also recognising the differing
        problems between the countries. Moreover, under the agreement, countries are accountable for taking action on both mitigation and adaptation.
        The goal of the agreement was to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celcius and if possible, to aim for 1.5 degrees Celcius
        given the impending situation. </p>

        From 2005 to 2015, the number of deceased and missing people due to disasters per 100,000 population was 1.64 and has now 
        slowly dwindled down to 0.86 from 2012-2021. Moreover, the number of ocuntries with national policies to reduce the number of deceased victims 
        during a disaster has increased from 55 in 2015 to 126 in 2021. In accordance with this, 118 countries reported having some level of policy
        coherence with other global frameworks, like the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. However, the number of people affected by these disasters 
        per 100,000 people increased from 1,198 in 2005 to 2015 to 2,113 in 2012 to 2021.

        While some progress was seen in target 13.1, the same could not be said for target 13.2. At the momment, global temperatures
        have already risen by 1.1 degrees due to global greenhouse gas emissions which reached a record high in 2021. 
        Firstly, real-time data from 2022 also showed that there was no halt to the increase in emissions.
        In addition, the rate at which carbon dioxide levels increased from 2020 to 2021 was above the average yearly increase of the last decade and 
        is already 149% more than pre-industrial levels, which was the opposite of the target to reduce emissions.

        Research on 100 national curriculum frameworks disclosed that 47% of them did not mention climate change. Though 95% of teachers in 2021 were aware
        of the importance of teaching about the gravity of climate change, only a third of them managed to successfully explain the effects of climate change 
        on them and their region. Moreover, in 2022, 70% of youths were only ablee to explain the broad details of climate change.

        According to the OECD, there was a 4% increase in the financial aid for the climate supplied and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries
        from 2019 to 2020 amounting to 83.3 billion dollars but it still fell short of the 100 billion dollars goal. The financial aid is mainly used for mitigation
        and funding for adaptation continues to lag as financial flow to developing countries is 5 to 10 times lower than the required amount.
